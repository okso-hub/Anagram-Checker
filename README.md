# Anagram Checker

This prorgram checks, whether two words are an anagram or not.

## What is an anagram?

An anagram exists, when two words consist of the same characters, even when they have different meanings. For example: *inch = chin*

## How to run the program

Direct to the folder, where `main.py` is stored and run the program using the `python main.py` command.

Then you will have to enter two words. Let's take *inch* and *chin*.

```
Enter first word: Inch
Enter second word: Chin
```

After hitting enter, the program will check, if they are anagrams, which they are in this case.

```
Enter first word: Inch
Enter second word: Chin
Is an anagram.
